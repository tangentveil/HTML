<!-- Understanding Meta Tags in HTML

Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document and are essential for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Let’s break down the most commonly used meta tags and their functions:

<meta charset="UTF-8">:
This tag sets the character encoding for the HTML document to UTF-8, which is a universal character set supporting most languages and symbols. Using UTF-8 ensures proper display of text across different platforms.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:
This tag is crucial for responsive web design. It adjusts the webpage’s width to match the width of the user’s device (PC, tablet, mobile), making your website mobile-friendly.

<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">:
This tag ensures compatibility with Internet Explorer by forcing the browser to use the latest available rendering engine, making it useful for older versions of IE.

Meta Tags for SEO

<meta name="description" content="This is a description">:

This tag provides a short description of your webpage, which is often displayed in search engine results below the page title. It’s vital for improving click-through rates (CTR) in search engine results.

<meta name="keywords" content="html tutorial, css tutorial">:
Keywords are specific terms or phrases users might search for. Although search engines like Google no longer heavily rely on meta keywords, they can still be useful in some scenarios for SEO purposes. -->
