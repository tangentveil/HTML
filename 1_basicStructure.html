<!-- Understanding HTML Sections

DOCTYPE HTML:
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 file. It ensures the browser renders the page correctly according to the latest HTML standard.

<html lang="en">:
This tag opens the HTML document and specifies the language used in the document (in this case, English). The lang attribute helps search engines and screen readers understand the primary language of the content.

<head>:
The <head> section contains meta-information (information about the webpage). It includes:

Meta tags: These provide metadata like keywords, descriptions, and author details. For example, 
<meta charset="UTF-8"> defines the character set.
Title: The <title> tag defines the title that appears on the browser tab.
External resources: Links to CSS files, JavaScript files, and fonts are placed here using the <link> and <script> tags.

<body>:
The <body> section contains the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, and links. This is what users see when they open the webpage.

HTML Comments
To include non-executable notes or comments, use the following syntax:

Comments are ignored by the browser but are valuable for developers to annotate their code for clarity.
Shortcut for commenting text: Press Ctrl + / to toggle comments for selected text in most code editors.
Why Comments Are Important
As web pages grow larger, comments help developers understand the structure of their code.
Comments are useful for referencing parts of the code during future revisions, making collaboration easier. -->
