<!-- HTML Entities
Entities help display characters that are reserved in HTML or invisible on the page. For instance, if you want to display the less-than symbol < or greater-than symbol > in your HTML, which are typically used in HTML tags, you need to use the appropriate entity for them, otherwise, HTML will treat them as tags.


Extra Spaces: If you want to add extra spaces in HTML (which are usually ignored), you can use the &nbsp; entity, which represents a non-breaking space. 
For example, &nbsp;&nbsp; adds two spaces.

Reserved Characters: Reserved characters like <, >, &, etc., are used in HTML tags. To display them on a webpage as characters and not HTML syntax, use the corresponding entities:
< becomes &lt;
> becomes &gt;

Special Symbols: HTML provides entities for many common symbols:
Pound symbol: &pound;
Copyright symbol: &copy;
Registered trademark: &reg;
Left and right arrows: &larr; and &rarr;
Fractions: &frac14; (for ¼)
Displaying Reserved Characters

In the below example:
<p>Display the less-than symbol: &lt; and the greater-than symbol: &gt;</p>
Here, &lt; displays < and &gt; displays > on the webpage.

Additional Spaces with &nbsp;
By default, HTML collapses multiple spaces into a single space. To add extra spaces, you can use the non-breaking space entity &nbsp;.

Example:

<p>This is another &nbsp;&nbsp; paragraph with two extra spaces.</p>
This line will add two spaces between "another" and "paragraph".

Special Characters Example:
If you need to show special symbols, such as the Pound (£) sign or Copyright (©) sign, you can use their corresponding HTML entities:

<p>Pound currency symbol: &pound;</p>
<p>Copyright symbol: &copy;</p>
<p>Registered trademark symbol: &reg;</p>


HTML entities allow you to display characters that are either reserved by HTML or can't be typed easily. They start with & and end with ;, and there are numerous entities available for different characters and symbols.

Here’s a list of some common HTML entities you might use:

Space: &nbsp;
Less than: &lt;
Greater than: &gt;
Ampersand: &amp;
Quotation mark: &quot;
Pound (£): &pound;
Copyright (©): &copy;
Registered trademark (®): &reg; -->
